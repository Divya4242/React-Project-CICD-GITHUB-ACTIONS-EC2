## About OS Programs
1.	Page Replacement Algorithm :- The area of replacement policy is probably the most studied of any area of memory management. The replacement policy determines which page currently in memory is to be replaced. All of the policies have as their objective that the page to be removed should be the page least likely to be referenced in the near future. FIFO, LRU are different page replacement algorithms.
2.	Scheduling Algorithms :- The main objective of scheduling is to allocate processor time in such a way as to optimize one or more aspects of system behaviour. Mainly the focus is on effective and efficient utilization of the processor. An example is throughput, which is the rate at which processes are completed. FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling are different algorithms.
3.	Memory Partition :- Memory Partitioning is a technique in which if there is more than one partition freely available to accommodate a process’s request, a partition must be selected. To choose a particular partition, a partition allocation method is needed. A partition allocation method is considered better if it avoids internal fragmentation. First-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit are different techniques of memory partitioning.
